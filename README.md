## Gallery page
The Gallery page features a masonry style photo wall structured into three columns that display a sample of artworks. The number or columns will decrease as the device gets smaller. These photos are as stated just a sample of artworks, and will continually be updated with newer more relevant work. As of now these are the best images at hand but will as stated be updated.

## Visit Dagmar page
This page features contact information, some short information about Dagmars main place of business, how to book a visit and an iframe element containing a fully interactable and ready to use google maps session with Dagmars address already entered. The intention behind this page is to create a way of engouraging the user to take action and start planning their route to Dagmar Glemme Art Center.
#### Bonus feature:
While on the site with an iphone, all phone numbers on screen are by iOS default clickable, and will open a menu that suggests the user to call Dagmar or cancel the action.

### Minor disclaimer regarding my github commits
1. The commits where large chunks of code appear to have been pasted in are chunks that I have written in the devtools and then pasted back into the source code. I am new to coding and don't know if this is standard proceedure or not.
2. The commits and commit messages can sometimes seem unclear, sometimes insufficient and sometimes over encumbered with actions. This is a result of me tinkering in the source code instead of in the devtools, resulting in many small saves and changes. Forgive me for any inconvenience regarding this.
