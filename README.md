### Minor disclaimer regarding my github commits
1. The commits where large chunks of code appear to have been pasted in are chunks that I have written in the devtools and then pasted back into the source code. I am new to coding and don't know if this is standard proceedure or not.
2. The commits and commit messages can sometimes seem unclear, sometimes insufficient and sometimes over encumbered with actions. This is a result of me tinkering in the source code instead of in the devtools, resulting in many small saves and changes. Forgive me for any inconvenience regarding this.
